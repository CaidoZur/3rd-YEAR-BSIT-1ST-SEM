            <p>I'm not really sure if it's called a skill, but I can type without looking at the keyboard fast but I do sometimes lose the momentum.
                My parents also told me that I have a good way of communicating especially convincing people to buy my stuff 
                because I sometimes sell some of my old stuff in Facebook Marketplace. Another skill that I have that I appreciate is not giving up
                that easily. It may not be that much of a special skill, but the determination of not giving up and just keep moving forward is something not everyone can do.</p>
