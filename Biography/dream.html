            <p>Personally I don't have a goal or a main goal in my life. I just feel like living in the moment and just let the world continue to go around. But there is one thing
                that spiked on my mind when I entered college, and that is to repay my parents for the sacrifices they did for me and my older brother that would give us a future
                that would exceed from what we expect from ourselves. So right now my goal is to finish college and for the rest, we will just see.
