            <p>I was born outside of the Philippines. In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 7, 2003. My father is an OFW and decided to bring my mother with her abroad so that is where 
                me and my older brother was born. We went back to the Philippines with my mom and my older brother because he was about to enter college, 
                my parents decided that it would be better to settle here in the Philippines because if I were left in Riyadh, no one would take care of me, my father would go to work
                and my mom is here in Palawan with my brother. So they had a decision that I would continue my schooling here so that when I also enter college, it would be easy because
                we are already here in our home country.
